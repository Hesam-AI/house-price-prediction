# house-price-prediction
This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on various features such as income, number of rooms, population, and more.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: A synthetic USA housing dataset
- 5,000 rows, no missing data
- Features include:
  - Avg. Area Income
  - Avg. Area House Age
  - Avg. Area Number of Rooms
  - Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms
  - Area Population
  - Price (Target)

## 📊 Objective
Predict house prices using linear regression and evaluate model performance.

## ⚙️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared Score (R²)
- Visualization of **Actual vs Predicted Prices**
